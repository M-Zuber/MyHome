In MultiInput form
	Maybe add option of recurrence per week


Things to look up:
	when adding a month to a date time object, how do i move the day back to the original day
	ex.
		start at Jan 31
		next month is Feb 28
		now for march i want it to go to 30
		and when it can, to go back to 31
			In other words if it was the last day of the start month than it should always be the last day
				of the current month
